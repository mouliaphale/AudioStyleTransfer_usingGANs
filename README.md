# AudioStyleTransfer_usingGANs

This repository contains the final project done as part of the course EE599 - Deep Learning at the University of Southern California.

The project is on Audio Style Transfer of audio files where the main focus was on genre style transfer (Jazz to classical) using 3 types of GANs:
* VAEGAN
* ResNet GAN
* CycleGAN
The respository contains google colab notebooks with the data and code named according to the type of GAN architecture used.

Each of these GANs were trained for about 100-200 epochs and ResNet GAN gives the best quality of style transfered audio files with minimal noise.
